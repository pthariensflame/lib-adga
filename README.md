lib-adga
========

My customized version of the Agda standard library.

Includes and integrates agda/agda-stdlib (stable version 7), agda/agda-finite-prover (current development version), and agda/agda-assoc-free (current development version), plus some additions of my own.

Parts of this might eventually get merged into agda/agda-stdlib, if I think they're good enough.

The point of this repository is really just so that I have a stable place to keep the additions I write.
